# MIT-Course-Tree
First web-scraping project. Attempt to scrape MIT course listing websites for course data and arrange courses into tree structure based on prerequisites. Hopefully could one day be useful tool for visually-minded MIT students when choosing courses and planning graduation requirements.
So far succeeded at scraping prerequisite information for classes in mathematics department and visualizing prereq tree. Difficult because each major has idiosyncrasies in naming courses
